    "description": "A Salsify service that uses Apollo Federation to serve a unified 'supergraph' composed of disparate GraphQL APIs from microservices. At runtime, the Gateway decomposes GraphQL requests into one or more subgraph GraphQL requests and returns the unified results to the client. It consists of two components: the Router (Apollo Router instance) and the Coprocessor (Go HTTP server for Salsify-specific logic like organization segmentation and JWT scoping).",
