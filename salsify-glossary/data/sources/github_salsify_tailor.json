    "description": "A Ruby gem for Target Schema generation and utilities. Provides tools for building, validating, and testing Target Schemas programmatically. Includes RSpec matchers for asserting Target Schema properties (field values, required conditions, applicable scopes, max length), a Target Schema Validator, and support for working with workbooks and worksheets. The gem handles field constraints including allowed/disallowed character regexes, GTIN formats, min/max values, decimal places, combined lengths, and number of values.",
