## Salsify

For Salsify context, when you encounter acronyms or terms you don't recognize in a codebase or document, use the `search` tool from the salsify-glossary MCP server to find definitions. The tool accepts either a single query or an array of queries. If unsure whether something is a company-specific term, look it up - it's better to check than to guess.
